# SQL - Data Warehousing & Data Analytics Project
This project demonstrates practical skills in **data warehousing design**, **SQL-based analytics**, and **insight generation** from enterprise data sources.

---
## 📌Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **data warehousing and analytics solution** using two source systems:
- **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**
- **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**

The solution follows the **Bronze–Silver–Gold (Medallion) architecture** to ingest, transform, and analyze data using SQL.

---

## 🏗️Data Warehouse Architecture
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from CRM and ERP sources
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, standardized, and transformed data
- **Gold Layer**: Business-level aggregated tables for analytics and reporting

---
## 📊Data Analytics
The project includes a comprehensive collection of **SQL scripts** for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.  
These scripts are designed to help analysts and BI professionals efficiently analyze relational data.

### Analytics Covered
- Database exploration
- Measures and metrics
- Time-based trends
- Cumulative analytics
- Segmentation analysis
- Advanced SQL analytics

Each SQL script focuses on a specific analytical theme and follows SQL best practices.
